# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Neural Network

This project uses a neural network model to predict the **potability of water** based on physicochemical parameters. Built with Python and Keras in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Input Features:** pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity
- **Output:** Binary classification - **Potable (1)** or **Not Potable (0)**
- **Model:** Simple Feedforward Neural Network with Keras
